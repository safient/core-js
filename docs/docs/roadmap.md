## 2020 - Q4

### Safient concept ideation ðŸ’¡

- We began our user research for the problem and solution that we devised for crypto asset inheritance.
- Evaluated the technical and economical feasibility of the solution by integrating solutions such as Ceramic network, Textile ThreadDB, Kleros,  IPFS/ Filecoin.

## 2021 - FEB

### The genesis of a sister product of Safient at ETHDenver ðŸš€

We built a confidential portfolio sharing application ([Portex](https://portex.xyz/)) at [ETHDenver 2021](https://devfolio.co/submissions/portex-7c58) to validate the technical feasibility. Portex gained a lot of traction for the implementation and was recognized as one of the top 20 hacks ðŸŽŠ.

## 2021 - APRIL

### Safient design and prototype âœ¨

Taking all the feedback from our hackathon project, we started to design and prototype the solution for Safient. We planned all the features and integrations, laid out our architecture for the initial implementation, and conducted a detailed user research survey to verify our solution approach.

Safient was one of the top 3 projects in the [DoraHack's Filecoin Grant](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/249k-for-17-projects-from-dorahacks-filecoin-grant-hackathon/) program.

## 2021 - Q4

Private beta demo to the community. Features include:

- Initial community edition application for safekeeping and inheritance with a few safe claim approach.
- SDKs to communicate with our alpha version of Safient protocol.

## 2022 - Q1

### Beta release to the community ðŸš€

Features include:

- Well tested and audited contracts for inheritance claims
- Well tested Safient protocol to create, access, claim safes
